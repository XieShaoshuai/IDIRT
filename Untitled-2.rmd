This template demonstrates many of the bells and whistles of the `reprex::reprex_document()` output format. The YAML sets many options to non-default values, such as using `#;-)` as the comment in front of output.

## Code style

Since `style` is `TRUE`, this difficult-to-read code (look at the `.Rmd` source file) will be restyled according to the Tidyverse style guide when it's rendered. Whitespace rationing is not in effect!

```{r}
x <- 1
```
